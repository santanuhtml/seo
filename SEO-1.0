----------------------------------
2. Keyword Research
----------------------------------
> For On Page SEO, Keyword Research is the most important task.

> First we have to find out services/products and make a list

> Just type above selected keywords on google search engine (Without enter) and 
  check the suggestions and also include them to our above list.
  Note: If no one type 'Best' do not need to select best for service.
 
> Above this list add on google keyword planner to find our
  Target Keywords.
  
> First focus on Low and Medium Long keyword keywords (Note: minimum 3 to 6 months)
  After this we may focus on higher keywords.

> Long keyword is better for SEO because have low compidition.

> Make a excel sheet for keywords with Keyword, Avg. monthly searches, 
  Competition, Competition indexed (0 => Low competition)

# Compitation Analysis:
  > Best Chrismas cake (Hight)
  > Best Chrismas cake in kolkata (Low)
  > Best Chrismas cake in Picnic Garden (Low)
  
# Tips:
  > *** Use a keyword which will create actual coversion not only bring traffic ***
    Not only focus on Volume of search, focus on keywords which may bring Coversions!
    
  > *** After selecting keywords, check organic copetator's <title> and meta description 
    to get better idea about actual conversion keywords!***
  
-----------------
3. Title tags
-----------------
> Write <title> tag upto 70 characters.

> Creating <title> tag is most important task for On page SEO.

> Add <title> tag just after <head> tag.

> * Home page is most important page for SEO, so use
  most important keyword in Home page <title> tag. 

> * Same keyword not add on both pages. We may use conbimation of them.
    Example: Web Application Development - Page 1
  	     Web Application Developers  - Page 2

> We do not need to add 'in' on <title>, google itself take it.

> Try to Add Brand name on home page and About us page <title>
    
# Tips:
  > If our Main service keyword or Primary keyword is Hight, then we may 
    use this keyword with location initially. check below note.
  
# Note:
  > We may initially use Low compitation keyword on our <title> tag but 
    also keep in mind for High compitation in future without changing <title> tag.
    Example:
    <title> tag
    2024: best chrismas cake in kolkata
    2025: best chrismas cake in kolkata, India
    => ** Here we do not change the title tag, Just add 'India' and it sitll 
       should be under 70 characters. So mind it when creating a <title> tag.
       
    Backlink:
    2024: best chrismas cake in kolkata
    2025: best chrismas cake
    
  > ** We can not change <title> tag: otherwise our old SEO related work 
    will be useless. So keep it Mind when we planning <title> tag and
    make <title> tag fixeble under 70 characters.
    
# Blog:   

1. Avoid keyword stuffing:Keyword stuffing affects your rank negatively. 
   It also comes off as spammy to users.
   Here’s an example of a keyword-stuffed title tag:
   Photo Books | Custom Photo Books | Best Photo Books | Make Your Own Photo Book
   Groomsmen gifts, Groomsman Gifts, Gifts for Men, Unique Gifts.
   
   use only ONE keyword on you title. If that keyword is very short, 
   you could add another keyword, but DO NOT use above two keywords.
   An excellent example of a title tag with two keywords is:	
   Photo Books | Create Professional Photo Books Online | Your Brand
   Groomsmen gifts and unique men’s gifts by The Man Registry.
   
2. Use your main keyword first when creating a title tag, 
   where users can see it.
   Example: Photo Books – Create Custom Photo Books | Walgreens Photo

3. Use different <title> elements for each page. 
   Your title tags should reflect the unique information you describe on each page.
   Example:
   Home Page: Groomsmen gifts and unique men’s gifts by The Man Registry.
   Product Category Page: BBQ sets and utensil gifts for groomsmen by The Man Registry.
   Product Page: 5-Piece Customized BBQ utensil set by The Man Registry.

4. <title> and <h1> tag string should be different. we can write a shorter <title> for Google 
   and a bit longer <h1> for your readers.
   
5. Consider including Site Name or Brand Name at the end of each <title> element, 
   separated with hyphen, colon, or pipe, like this:

6. Use the same language: If a page is written in Hindi, make sure to write the <title> 
   element in Hindi (don't write title text in English).

7. Make it clear which text is the main title for the page. using a larger font, 
   putting the title text in the first visible <h1> element on the page,

-----------------
4. Meta Description
-----------------
> Write Meta Description with in Use 120 to 156 character.

# Note
  > Do not use '.' on <title> tag but we may use it on our Description
  
# Blog:

1. Create unique descriptions for each page on your site:
   create descriptions that accurately describe the specific page. Keep in mind that 
   meta descriptions is not strings of keywords which don't give users a clear idea 
   of the page's content.
   Good descriptions are human-readable and diverse.
   
2. Include relevant information:
   The meta description doesn't just have in sentence format, it may contain data also.
   For example, news or blog postings can list the author, date of publication, or byline information.
   Similarly, product pages might have price, age, manufacturer.
   A good meta description can bring all this data together.
   Example:
   <meta name="description" content="Written by A.N. Author, Illustrated by V. Gogh, Price: $17.99, 
   Length: 784 pages">

3. Here are some examples of how a meta description can be improved:
   Example:1
   Bad (list of keywords):
   <meta name="description" content="Sewing supplies, yarn, colored pencils, sewing machines, threads, 
   bobbins, needles">
   
   Better (explains what the shop sells and details like opening hours and location):
   <meta name="description" content="Get everything you need to sew your next garment. Open 
   Monday-Friday 8-5pm, located in the Fashion District.">

   Example:2
   Bad (doesn't summarize the page):
   <meta name="description" content="Eggs are a source of joy in everyone's life. When I was 
   a small child, I remember picking eggs from the hen house and bringing them to the kitchen. 
   Those were the days.">
   
   Better (summarizes the whole page):
   <meta name="description" content="Learn how to cook eggs with this complete guide in 1 hour 
   or less. We cover all the methods, including: over-easy, sunny side up, boiled, and poached.">

   Example:3
   Bad (too short):
   <meta name="description" content="Mechanical pencil">
   
   Better (specific and detailed):
   <meta name="description" content="Self-sharpening mechanical pencil that autocorrects your penmanship.
    Includes 2B auto-replenishing lead. Available in both Vintage Pink and Schoolbus Yellow. Order 50+ pencils, 
    get free shipping.">

4. The best meta descriptions use keywords early in the snippet in a natural way. Those keywords 
   support the page’s content and goals. 
   
5. Having the brand name in the meta description is often unnecessary and should be avoided whenever possible.
   But if it’s needed for context – or if you need to satisfy some characters to ensure you’re hitting minimum 
   length requirements – have at it.  

> Optimized Meta Descriptions ARE Important For SEO:
  search engine ranking algorithm does not consider meta descriptions as a factor. 
  Thus, from a strict algorithmic perspective, it’s not  necessary to put your most 
  important keywords in the meta description.

> We may add some words on meta Description to increase CTA:
  Adjective + Benefit + CTA + Confidence Booster

-----------------
5. Body Content
----------------- 
> Title keywords must use in body content

> h tag / Title tag should contain Keywords

> Body content should have <strong> tags, 3% to 5% under
  1000 words.
  
> alt tag should contain keywords which should not count under
  keyword density. Use alt tag text with meaning full way.
  
> If we stuck anyware then check competitors activity.

> keyword density of around 1% to 2%.
  For 1000 words and target keyword appears 10 times, the keyword density would be:
  (10 / 1000) * 100 = 1%

> If body content don't have our title keywords then ask client to add them.
  Some time it was not possible/ client do not want to add those keywords,
  then we may take help 'position:absolute;' to add our keyword on content.
  
  
> Few website like ecommerce, product list do not have so much content,
  then we may add content with keyword on above footer section.
  check https://www.flipkart.com/ for this.

----------------------------------
6. FAQ
----------------------------------
> For Page rank we may use FAQ section.
> We may also add specific FAQ Page on our website.
Note: 
> Let we add 5 faq on our webiste home page and add Read More button. On our
  FAQ page we add all faq list including Home page 5 faqs but to avoide 
  Google penalty we may add modify and add more content those first 5 faqs on
  our FAQ page.

----------------------------------
7. robots.txt
----------------------------------
> A robots.txt file tells search engine crawler which URLs can access on our site.

> keep it on root of the project	
  
> crawling and indexing:
  Sanning our website by search engine called crawling and keep its data called indexing.

> Normally search engin do this within 21 days.

> User-agent: *       		=> Allow all search engine to crawling
> Disallow: /wp-admin/  	=> Not allow to crawling this login page
> User-agent: *#      		=> XXXXXX Not Allow any search engine so SEO not works XXXXX
> Sitemap: https://eventophotography.com/wp-sitemap.xml 


----------------------------------
8. sitemap.xml
----------------------------------
> All pages must add on sitemap.

> A sitemap tells to search engines which pages and files we think 
  are important in our site,

> Priority List:
  1.0 => Home page
  0.9 => Services page/ Product page
  0.8 => FAQ Page
  0.0 => Low Priority
  
> Use minimum priority 0.4

> * Remove <lastmod> and others unwnated links

> We can also add Image url on our sitemap which is good for SEO.

> For few page WordPress site we can add custom sitemap and this link
  to robots.txt file
  
> Few page website with blog post we can submit two sitemap on robots.txt file
  i. First custom sitemap for few pages
  ii. Second sitemap for Blog Post which is generated by wordPress

# Query:
  > Should we use default sitemap for wordpress? => Yes
  > Should we add Image url on sitemap? => Yes, good for SEO
  
# Blog:

> We can also provides valuable information on sitemap like last updated and 
  any alternate language versions of the page.
  Example:
------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
   <url>
      <loc>https://www.example.com/page1</loc>
      <lastmod>2024-04-09</lastmod>
      <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
      <priority>0.8</priority>
   </url>
   <url>
      <loc>https://www.example.com/page2</loc>
      <lastmod>2024-04-08</lastmod>
      <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
      <priority>0.9</priority>
   </url>
   <!-- Add more URLs as needed -->
</urlset>

------------
  
> Using sitemap we can also provide specific type of content 
  like video, image, and news content. 
Example:
** Note:
. Each <url> tag can contain up to 1,000 <image:image> tags. 
. we need to add `xmlns:image="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1"`, 
which associates the <image:image>
------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"
        xmlns:image="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1">
   <url>
      <loc>https://www.example.com/page1</loc>
      <lastmod>2024-04-09</lastmod>
      <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
      <priority>0.8</priority>
      <image:image>
         <image:loc>https://example.com/image1.jpg</image:loc>
      </image:image>
      <image:image>
         <image:loc>https://example.com/image2.jpg</image:loc>
      </image:image>
   </url>
   <!-- Add more URLs as needed -->
</urlset>
------------

> Sitemap size limits: is upto 50MB (uncompressed) or 50,000 URLs. 
  If you have a larger file or more URLs, you must break your sitemap into 
  multiple sitemaps.
  
> ** Informing search engine crawlers: Once we create Sitmap file, then we have to inform
  search engines by doing -
  . specifying the location in your site's robots.txt file
  . submitting it to them via the search engine's submission interface
  . sending an HTTP request

> As with all XML files, all tag values must be entity escaped.
  Example:
  & ->	&amp;

> Take help of GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE to track sitemap crowle or not or any issue on it.
